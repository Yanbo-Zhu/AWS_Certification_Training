# 3 Shared Responsibility Model Alternate

Costumer 和 CSP Cloud service provider 到底各自负责什么 

the share responsibility model is a simple visualization that helps determine what the customer is responsible for and what the csp is responsible for

- The Customer
    - The Customer is responsible for the data and the configuration of access controls that resides in AWS 
    - The Customer is responsible fir the configuration of cloud services and grating access to users via permissions 
- The CSP is generally responsible for the underlying infrastructure 

Responsibility of in the cloud: If you can configure or store it, then you (the costumer) are responsible for it 
Responsibility of the cloud: If you can not configure , then you CSP is responsible for it
