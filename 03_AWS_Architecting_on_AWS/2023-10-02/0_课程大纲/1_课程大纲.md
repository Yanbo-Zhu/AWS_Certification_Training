If you have this working knowledge and have not taken AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials, familiarize yourself with Amazon Web Services (AWS) basic cloud services. For more information, see “AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials” in AWS Skill Builder at https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/134/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials.

# 3 Lab

![](image/Pasted%20image%2020231002084057.png)

The capstone lab is the final project for this course.
During the lab, you are provided with a scenario that discusses a business need. Review the requirements and use what you have learned in this course to complete the list of tasks. 
You learn more about the capstone lab at the end of this course.

You build this multi-tier architecture in the capstone lab. During check-ins, you discuss specific services that are outlined here and how they interact with each other.
Note: The diagram on this slide contains several abbreviations. The following list includes some services that are not covered in this module, but are included for completeness: 
• EFS  Amazon Elastic File Service 
• Aurora   Amazon Aurora
• NAT  network address translation
• VPC   Amazon Virtual Private Cloud

Image description: 
The diagram shows a single AWS Region with one virtual private cloud (VPC) and two Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone contains a public subnet, an app subnet, and a database subnet. An bi-directional arrow outside the VPC routes through an internet gateway, to an Application Load Balancer. The Application Load Balancer is not in a subnet or an Availability Zone. The arrow continues to the Auto Scaling group that has app servers in the app subnets of both Availability Zones. 
Each app server communicates with an EFS mount target in its own subnet to reach the EFS file system, which is not inside an Availability Zone. All app servers communicate with an Amazon Aurora primary DB instance in one of the database subnets. 
The other database subnet holds the Aurora replica. A two-sided arrow points between the Aurora primary and Aurora replica. A bi-directional arrow points from the app servers and travels through each Availability Zone’s NAT gateway. The NAT gateways are in the public subnet of each Availability Zone. The arrows travel through each NAT gateway, and exit the VPC through the internet gateway. End description

Each module starts with a check-in poll question.
Then you are introduced to a stakeholder at the beginning of each module. They have brought business requests to you. Their questions have informed you of what you should research to support Example Corp. in their cloud journey. Your instructor prepares you to present solutions to the stakeholder by teaching you about services and best practices for building on AWS.
At the end of each module, your instructor asks 2–5 questions to help you review the topics and services that are covered in the module. In some sections, you also check in on the capstone architecture to see what you have learned that relates to the final capstone lab.
If you are attending virtually, use the live group chat to raise your hand and ask questions.


![](image/Pasted%20image%2020231002084245.png)

The business request page at the beginning of the module is structured in this way.
At the end of the module, you review the questions that the stakeholder asked, and you provide solutions to fit their use case.


# 4 Supplemental Learning 


![](image/Pasted%20image%2020231016200127.png)

You can use the Online Course Supplement (OCS) to continue your journey after you complete this course. You can also use it to dive deeper on topics that are not covered in detail in this course.
To find the OCS for this course, see AWS Skill Builder. For more information, see Architecting on AWS – Online Course Supplement at https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/8319/architecting-on-aws-online-course-supplement.


![](image/Pasted%20image%2020231002084353.png)

As part of their role, solutions architects research topics and find additional information about features and services to make decisions. AWS services are constantly improving and evolving. Use AWS documentation to find user guides, developer guides, API references, tutorials, and more.
Documentation is provided in HTML, PDF, and GitHub.
For more information about user guides, developer guides, API references, and tutorials, see AWS Documentation at https://docs.aws.amazon.com
