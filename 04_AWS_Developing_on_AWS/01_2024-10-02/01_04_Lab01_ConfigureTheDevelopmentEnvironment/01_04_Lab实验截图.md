## 1.5 Task 0: Connect to your development environment

In this task, you will connect to your development environment.

3. From a browser tab opened to the **AWS Management Console**, use the **AWS search bar** to search for and choose **Cloud9**.
4. On the **Environments** page, next to the **Lab1** environment listing, choose **Open**.

**Note:** By default the AWS Cloud9 environment will open with a different theme. If you want to use a consistent theme for each lab, this is configured in the **Welcome** tab in the card with a title of **Configure AWS Cloud9**. You can choose a theme that is dark, gray, or light.

**Note:** When lab instructions in subsequent sections require you to issue commands, use the **AWS Cloud9 Terminal**.

**Consider:** This lab is designed for both experienced and newer developers:

- For more experienced developers who enjoy a challenge, there are **High-Level Instructions** before each task that should provide you enough information to help you complete the task.
    
- Once you complete the updates test your code to ensure it works, troubleshoot if needed, and then move on to the next task.
    
- For newer developers, there are **Detailed Instructions** to guide you through each step of the lab.
    

---

## 1.6 Task 1: Review the development environment

In this set of tasks, you will verify that the IDE and AWS CLI have been installed and configured. You will learn where the application code files, used in upcoming labs, will be stored. Next, you will disable the AWS managed temporary credentials set by default in AWS Cloud9.

High-Level Instructions:

- Verify that Python is installed.
- Verify that AWS CLI V2 is installed.
- Disable the AWS managed credentials in the AWS Cloud9 environment.
- Run

 to set the **region** value to the value, shown on the pane left of these instructions, and **output** to- .
- Verify that the -  is attached to the **AWS Cloud9** environment.

Detailed Instructions:

### 1.6.1 Task 1.1: Verify installation of an IDE

5. **Command:** To verify which version of **Python** is installed run the following command:

```
python --version
```

**Expected Output:**

```
******************************
**** This is OUTPUT ONLY. ****
******************************

Python 3.7.10
```

**Note:** This indicates that **Python 3.7.10** is installed. Your version may be newer than the version listed.

### 1.6.2 Task 1.2: Verify installation of the AWS CLI

6. **Command:** From the terminal, verify that the **AWS CLI** is installed by running the following command:

```
aws --version
```

**Expected output:**

```
******************************
**** This is OUTPUT ONLY. ****
******************************

aws-cli/2.7.4 Python/3.9.11 Linux/4.14.276-211.499.amzn2.x86_64 exe/x86_64.amzn.2 prompt/off
```

**Note:** The output indicates the version of the AWS CLI installed is **version 2**. Your version may be newer than the version listed.

### 1.6.3 Task 1.3: Deactivate the AWS managed temporary credentials setting

In an AWS Cloud9, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) development environment, temporary AWS access credentials are made available to you. We call these AWS managed temporary credentials. You don’t need to manually set up, manage, or attach an instance profile to the Amazon EC2 instance that connects to the environment.

- [Learn more about AWS managed temporary credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/how-cloud9-with-iam.html#auth-and-access-control-temporary-managed-credentials)

**Note:** Although the AWS managed temporary credentials can be useful and time saving in many cases, sometimes you may find yourself in a situation where you need elevated credentials to complete a task. For example, in this lab we have attached an instance profile to the AWS Cloud9 Amazon EC2 instance as a security best-practice.

You will open the AWS Cloud9 environment and deactivate the AWS managed temporary credentials.

7. Choose the (gear icon) from the top-right to open the **AWS Cloud9 Preferences** > **AWS SETTINGS** > Untoggle **AWS managed temporary credentials** .

**Note:** The last step, which will enable you to query AWS services using temporary credentials, is to set the region in the

 file.

8. Close the **Preferences** tab as you no longer need it open.
    
9. **Command:** Use the **AWS Cloud9 terminal** to remove any existing credentials if they still exist.
    

```
rm /home/ec2-user/.aws/credentials
```

**Note:** Typically, you will not need to run the above command. The credentials should not exist after you untoggle the **AWS managed temporary credentials**. But if they still exist, the above command will delete them. After running the command you might receive the following output which is perfectly fine.

```
rm: cannot remove ‘/home/ec2-user/.aws/credentials’: No such file or directory
```

10. **Command:** Use the **AWS Cloud9 terminal** to run the

 command. You need to update the value for

, with the region value shown to the left of these instructions. And then set the output as

10. .

**Note:** In this example, the region set to **ap-northeast-1** but in your lab this region may be different.

```
aws configure
```

11. When prompted, verify the following:

- **AWS Access Key ID** [leave blank]: _Press ENTER_
- **AWS Secret Access Key** [leave blank]: _Press ENTER_
- **Default region name** [update to proper region]:

- 
- **Default output format** [update to yaml]:

- 

**Example:**

```
**********************************
**** This is an EXAMPLE ONLY. ****
**********************************

AWS Access Key ID [None]: 
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: 
Default region name [None]: ap-northeast-1
Default output format [None]: yaml
```

12. **Command:** Using the [AWS CLI Command Reference for AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS)](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/sts/index.html), choose the correct command to run to verify which credentials AWS Cloud9 is now using to authenticate requests for **TODO 1**:

- Choice A

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

- Choice B

```
aws sts decode-authorization-message
```

**Expected output:**

```
******************************
**** This is OUTPUT ONLY. ****
******************************

Account: '710606863198'
Arn: arn:aws:sts::710606863198:assumed-role/notes-application-role/i-047954185d0aa81f3

```

**Answer:** You can find the solution to this step in the [TODO 1 Solution](https://us-east-1.durian.bkr.team.aws.training/session/g9ejfdE9W5d1hgjkYVHaSV?locale=en-US&reference=5M7bxRH1nqb4DNbWEh7Gx1%3A%3A55c478a5-5011-4ac5-ba78-f422e4cc1acf#todo-1-solution) section at the bottom of these instructions.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully reviewed the development environment.

---

## 1.7 Task 2: Review the AWS Toolkit options

Now that AWS CLI is configured, verify that the **AWS Toolkit** is functional.

High-Level Instructions

- Open the **AWSToolkit** extension window.
- Verify the **profile** is set to use

- .
- Verify the **region** matches the value to the left of these instructions.
- Review the service resources in the **AWS Explorer**.

Detailed Instructions

13. From the side menu, choose the (**AWS** icon) which represents a link to the **AWS Explorer**.

- It should automatically connect because it will use the instance profile attached to the instance. This is represented using **ec2:instance**.
- Make sure the **Region** matches the region value shown to the left of these instructions.

**Note**: If **AWS Explorer** was not automatically refresh the connection from

 to

, right-click on the

 item and select **Switch Connections**. Select then the entry that starts with **ec2:instance**

14. Using the **AWS Explorer**, you can view, create, update, and delete resources for various AWS services. You may want to review the services to familiarize yourself with the options available.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully reviewed the AWS Toolkit.

---

## 1.8 Task 3: Verify IAM Permissions

In this set of tasks, you will run a command to list the Amazon S3 buckets in this account, attempt to delete a bucket, and then run the

 command to see where it fails.

High-Level Instructions:

- Run

 -  command to **view** all S3 buckets.
- Run command to **delete** an obsolete S3 bucket with -  in the name.
- Run command to **delete** an obsolete S3 bucket with -  in the name, and use the debug option.

Detailed Instructions:

### 1.8.1 Task 3.1: Run AWS CLI Amazon S3 command to view buckets

15. **Command:** From a command interface, run the following command to list the Amazon S3 buckets:

```
aws s3 ls
```

**Similar output expected:**

```
******************************
**** This is OUTPUT ONLY. ****
******************************

2022-03-24 17:58:33 6nzxc1sjkmar-lab1deletemebucket-t63kd50lk000
2022-03-24 17:58:34 6nzxc1sjkmarkw5g4ugi-lab1bucket-1g9fvp2ico63h
```

**Note:** Buckets listed in this output are limited to those with the

 in the name. Your list may include others not mentioned here. They will also have text before the **lab1** descriptor.

### 1.8.2 Task 3.2: Run an AWS CLI Amazon S3 command to delete bucket

16. Run the following command to create a variable named **bucketToDelete** to use to specify the bucket name in future commands.

**Note:** This limits the bucket to only the bucket with **deleteme** in the name.

```
bucketToDelete=$(aws s3api list-buckets --output text --query 'Buckets[?contains(Name, `deletemebucket`) == `true`] | [0].Name')
```

**Expected Output:**

None, unless there is an error.

17. **Command:** Choose the correct command that will delete the bucket with

 17.  in the name for **TODO 2**. Use the [AWS CLI Command Reference for Amazon S3](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/index.html) as needed.

- Choice A

```
aws s3 remove-bucket s3://$bucketToDelete
```

- Choice B

```
aws s3 rb s3://$bucketToDelete
```

**Expected output:**

```
******************************
**** This is OUTPUT ONLY. ****
******************************

remove_bucket failed: s3://6nzxc1sjkmar-lab1deletemebucket-t63kd50lk000 An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the DeleteBucket operation: Access Denied
```

**Answer:** You can find the solution to this step in the [TODO 2 Solution](https://us-east-1.durian.bkr.team.aws.training/session/g9ejfdE9W5d1hgjkYVHaSV?locale=en-US&reference=5M7bxRH1nqb4DNbWEh7Gx1%3A%3A55c478a5-5011-4ac5-ba78-f422e4cc1acf#todo-2-solution) section at the bottom of these instructions.

You encountered the error, **Access Denied**. It appears there is a permissions issue with running this command.

### 1.8.3 Task 3.3: Run an AWS CLI Amazon S3 command to delete bucket using --debug

When you include the **–debug** option it includes details such as:

- Looking for credentials
- Parsing the provided parameters
- Constructing the request sent to AWS servers
- The contents of the request sent to AWS
- The contents of the raw response
- The formatted output

18. **Command:** From a command interface, run the following command to delete the bucket with

 18.  in the name.

```
aws s3 rb s3://$bucketToDelete --debug
```

**Note:** The output can be rather lengthy, so the bulleted list below highlights the information in the output that will help you to understand the process and why the request was denied.

**Expected output:**

- Start of debug which breaks down the request into the individual arguments.

```

This command failed because the **notes-application-role** does not have the

 IAM permission delegated to it.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully verified the IAM permissions.

## 1.9 Task 4: Add the missing permissions to your developer role

In this set of tasks, to address the permission issue you just encountered, you need to assign the appropriate permission to the **notes-application-role**. To save some time you will use a managed **IAM policy** that has already been created. First you will review the policy, which contains the

 permission, and then you will attach it to the

. Then you will run the command to delete the bucket with

 in the name.

**Note:** In most organizations, control of granting, removing, and elevating IAM permissions is administered by a member of the security team. For learning purposes, we have enabled you the ability to add a customer managed policy with the **s3:DeleteBucket** permission and apply it to this specific role.

High-Level Instructions:

- Run

 command to review permissions for **version 1** of the- .
- Run command to attach the to the- .
- Run command to remove the obsolete bucket with -  in the name.

Detailed Instructions:

### 1.9.1 Task 4.1: Review a customer managed IAM policy

19. **Command:** Run the command below to assign the policy ARN value to the **$policyArn** variable which will be used in the next command.

```
policyArn=$(aws iam list-policies --output text --query 'Policies[?PolicyName == `S3-Delete-Bucket-Policy`].Arn')
```

**Expected output:**

None, unless there was an error.

20. **Command:** Run the command below to review the policy document for the

 20.  policy. This policy was created for you to grant delete bucket permissions for your role.

```
aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn $policyArn --version-id v1
```

**Expected output:**

```

    Version: '2012-10-17'
  IsDefaultVersion: true
  VersionId: v1
```

### 1.9.2 Task 4.2: Attach the IAM policy to the notes-application-role

21. **Command:** Attach the

 policy to the 21.  role using the correct command for **TODO 3**, based on the [AWS CLI Command Reference for IAM](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/index.html)

**Note:** You will specify the **$policyArn** variable for the

 value.

- Choice A

```
aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn $policyArn --role-name notes-application-role
```

- Choice B

```
aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn $policyArn --user-name notes-application-role
```

**Expected output:**

None, unless there is an error.

**Answer:** You can find the solution to this step in the [TODO 3 Solution](https://us-east-1.durian.bkr.team.aws.training/session/g9ejfdE9W5d1hgjkYVHaSV?locale=en-US&reference=5M7bxRH1nqb4DNbWEh7Gx1%3A%3A55c478a5-5011-4ac5-ba78-f422e4cc1acf#todo-3-solution) section at the bottom of these instructions.

### 1.9.3 Task 4.3: Review the policies attached to the role

- **Command:** To verify the policy was added, run the following IAM command:

```
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name notes-application-role
```

**Expected output:**

```
******************************
**** This is OUTPUT ONLY. ****
******************************

AttachedPolicies:

- PolicyArn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess
  PolicyName: ReadOnlyAccess
- PolicyArn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
  PolicyName: AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
```

### 1.9.4 Task 4.4: Run the bucket delete command and verify it has been deleted

22. **Command:** Now that the **notes-application-role** has the permissions to delete the bucket with

 22.  in the name, run the command below:

```
aws s3 rb s3://$bucketToDelete
```

**Expected output:**

```
******************************
**** This is OUTPUT ONLY. ****
******************************

remove_bucket: 6nzxc1sjkmar-lab1deletemebucket-t63kd50lk000
```

23. **Command:** To verify the bucket has been removed using the **command interface**, type the command below:

```
aws s3 ls
```

**Expected output:**

```
