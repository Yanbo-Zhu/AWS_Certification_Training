You can use the following tools to interact with AWS: 
• AWS Management Console – This tool is the easiest place to start interacting with AWS services. It is a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage your AWS account and take actions.
• AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) – This tool is for managing AWS services by using the command line. AWS CLI version 1 is preinstalled on Amazon Linux and Amazon Linux 2 distributions.
• Software development kits (SDKs) – AWS provides AWS SDKs and the Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) in many common programming languages. You use these software development frameworks for defining and provisioning your cloud infrastructure by using code.


All of these tools connect to the same underlying AWS API to create resources and manage your AWS services.
