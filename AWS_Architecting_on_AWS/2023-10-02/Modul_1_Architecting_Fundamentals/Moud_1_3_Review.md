Increased agility? Faster to market and then you lower the complexity

Imagine that you are now ready to talk to the Chief Technology Officer, discuss what you have learned, and present solutions.

Think about how you would answer the questions from the beginning of the lesson.

Your answers should include the following solutions: 
• Use AWS services to increase agility while decreasing complexity and risk. 
• AWS global infrastructure is organized into AWS Regions. These Regions contain Availability Zones. You can also use AWS Local Zones and edge locations.
• Use the Well-Architected Framework, which helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient application infrastructures.

The correct answers are A, local data regulations, and C, latency to end users.

Choosing the right AWS Region is important. You must determine the right Region for your services, applications, and data, based on the following factors:
• Governance and legal requirements – Consider any legal requirements based on data governance, sovereignty, or privacy laws.
• Latency – Close proximity to customers means better performance. 
• Service availability – Not all AWS services are available in all Regions. 
• Cost – Different Regions have different costs. Research the pricing for the services that you plan to use, and compare costs to make the best decision for your workloads.

The correct answer is C, high availability for resources.
Availability Zones are multiple isolated areas within a particular geographic location. When you launch an instance, you can select an Availability Zone or let AWS choose one for you. You can distribute your instances across multiple Availability Zones. You can design your application so that if one instance fails, an instance in another Availability Zone can handle reques

Principle if least privilege:  就是不能给某个人 过多, 或者过少的 权限去 处理他的工作. 过多 他会瞎点, 过少, 他处理不了他的工作. 应该给他正好的权限.
