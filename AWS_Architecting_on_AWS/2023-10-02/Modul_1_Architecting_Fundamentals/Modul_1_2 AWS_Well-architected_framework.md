The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides consistent guidance for AWS architecting best practices

Solutions architects (SAs) are responsible for managing an organization’s cloud computing architecture. They have in-depth knowledge of the architectural principles and services that are used to do the following:
• Develop the technical cloud strategy based on business needs. 
• Assist with cloud migration efforts. 
• Review workload requirements. • Provide guidance on how to address high-risk issues.

Creating technology solutions is much like constructing a physical building. If the foundation is not solid, it can cause structural problems that undermine the integrity and function of the building. The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient application infrastructures. It is a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures and implement designs that can scale over time.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework started as a whitepaper. It has expanded to include domain-specific lenses, hands-on labs, and the AWS Well-Architected Tool.

The architectural reviews focus on the following pillars: 
• Security – Use AWS security best practices to build policies and processes to protect data and assets. Allow auditing and traceability. Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time.
• Cost optimization – Achieve cost efficiency while considering fluctuating resource needs. • Reliability – Meet well-defined operational thresholds for applications. This includes support to recover from failures, handling increased demand, and mitigating disruption.
• Performance efficiency – Deliver efficient performance for a set of resources like instances, storage, databases, space, and time.
• Operational excellence – Run and monitor systems that deliver business value. Continually improve supporting processes and procedures.
• Sustainability – Minimize and understand your environmental impact when running cloud workloads.

With the tool, you can gather data and get recommendations to: 
• Minimize system failures and operational costs. 
• Dive deep into business and infrastructure processes.
• Provide best practice guidance. 
• Deliver on the cloud computing value proposition.

The AWS WA Tool is a self-service tool. You can use it to review the state of your existing workloads and compare them to the latest AWS architectural best practices. It is designed to help architects and their managers review AWS workloads without the need for an AWS SA. This service is based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
To complete a Well-Architected review, use the tool in the console. All details are stored securely in your account. You can share results with your SA or partner resource for collaboration on the review or remediation steps.
