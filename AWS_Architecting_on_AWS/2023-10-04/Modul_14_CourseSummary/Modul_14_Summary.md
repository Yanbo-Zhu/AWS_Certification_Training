AWS Certification helps learners to build credibility and confidence by validating their cloud expertise with an industry-recognized credential. Certification helps organizations to identify skilled professionals who can lead cloud initiatives by using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The slide shows the AWS certifications that are currently available. To earn an AWS certification, you must earn a passing score on a proctored exam. Each certification level for role-based certifications provides a recommended experience level with AWS Cloud services as follows: • Professional – Two years of comprehensive experience designing, operating, and troubleshooting solutions by using the AWS Cloud
• Associate – One year of experience solving problems and implementing solutions by using the AWS Cloud • Foundational – Six months of fundamental AWS Cloud and industry knowledge

Specialty certifications focus on a particular technical domain. The recommended experience for taking a specialty exam is technical experience in the domain as specified in the exam guide.
AWS does not publish a list of all services or features that are covered in a certification exam. However, the exam guide for each exam lists the current topic areas and objectives that the exam covers. For more information, the exam guides and other preparation materials are available on the AWS Certification exam preparation page at https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/.
The information on this slide is current as of March 2023. However, exams are frequently updated, and the details regarding which exams are available—and what is tested by each exam—are subject to change. For more information about the latest AWS certification exam information, see the AWS Certification page at https://aws.amazon.com/certification/.
You are required to update your certification (or recertify) every 3 years. For more information, see the AWS Recertification page at https://aws.amazon.com/certification/recertification/.

Step one is getting to know the exam and exam-style questions.

Finally, determine your exam readiness by taking an official practice exam.
Each practice exam includes the same number of questions as the actual exam. The practice exams provide practice with the same question style, depth, and rigor as the certification exam. They include exam-style scoring and a pass or fail. You’ll also receive feedback on the answer choices for each question with recommended resources to deepen your understanding of key topics. You can determine whether you want to simulate the exam experience by taking a timed exam with answers only shown at the end. Or you can choose other options, like untimed, or with answers shown after submitting each question.
